HEART DISEASE PREDICTION


To predict whether a person is having heart disease or not.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Complete analysis of Heart Disease UCI dataset both visually and statistically to obtain critical observations which can be used for inference.


To predict whether a person has a heart disease or not based on the various biological and physical parameters of the body


To make a model having high accuracy and precision and can predict the results with greater confidence.


Make these predictions accessible to users and patients anywhere, anytime so that they can get complete picture of their Health

 DATASET ANALYSIS
 
 It's a clean, easy to understand set of data. However, the meaning of some of the column headers are not obvious. Here's what they mean,
 
 
age: The person's age in years


sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)


cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)


trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)


chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl


fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (&gt; 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)


restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)


thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved


exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)


ldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)


slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)


ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)


thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)


target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)

Here I have used different machine learning models.


Logistic Regression


Naive Bayes


SVM (Support Vector Machine)


K Nearest Neighbor


Decision tree

From the above 5 models it is concluded that Logistic Regression has better accuracy i.e  88.52% .


Here we notice that females are having more heart problems than males.
